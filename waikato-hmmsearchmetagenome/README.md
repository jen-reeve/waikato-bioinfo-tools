## Introduction

**waikato/hmmsearchmetagenome** is a bioinformatics pipeline that ...

<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Run a hmmsearch of a specified hmm profile against a specified metagenome file ([HMMER_HMMSEARCH](https://nf-co.re/modules/hmmer_hmmsearch/))
2. Clean the hmm output to be less obnoxious 
3. Extract the IDs of the sequences identified
4. Extract the full sequences identified ([SEQKIT_GREP](https://nf-co.re/modules/seqkit_grep/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):
-->
First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`sample.csv`:

```csv
hmm_profile,metagenome
NAD_lig_AD,UQ83.fasta
```

Each row represents a combination of a HMM profile and a metagenome to search



Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run waikato/hmmsearchmetagenome \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input sample.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
